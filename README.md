Stylistic Notes App: In the mobile application course, the instructor doesnâ€™t go into a lot of detail with styles and most of the apps look very bland. I wanted to create a simple notes application, only with more beautiful styles.
<hr />
When first opening the application, there is a sign up/sign in page that doesn't matter if you are creating an account of have an existing account it will log the user in.
After you user is signed in they can create notes by pressing "add note" and a screen will come down for the user to create a note. Once the user touches save the user will be placed back into the main note activity.
<br />
The user can access the note by touching it, and if they want to change the note, they can click on the text box and change the text and click save.
If the user wants to delete the note, they can simply long press on the note in the main note activity.
<br />
If the user wishes to sign out, there is a button that signs the user out in the bottom left.
